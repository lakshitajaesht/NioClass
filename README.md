This Python application demonstrates how to connect to a local SQLite database, perform data queries, process the retrieved data, and visualize the results using the Dash web framework.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: dash, pandas, sqlite3, sqlalchemy
Installation
Create a virtual environment (optional):
Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install required libraries:
Bash
pip install dash pandas sqlite3 sqlalchemy
Use code with caution.

Usage
Create the SQLite database: Run the Python script to create the example.db database and populate it with sample data.
Start the Dash application: Execute the Python script to launch the Dash web application.
Access the application: Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050 (or the specified port).
Database Structure
The application uses two tables in the SQLite database:

users:
user_id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
name (TEXT)
email (TEXT)
join_date (TEXT)
transactions:
transaction_id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
user_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY)
amount (REAL)
transaction_date (TEXT)
Data Processing and Visualization
The application performs the following tasks:

Queries users who joined within a specific date range.
Calculates the total amount spent by each user.
Generates a report showing each user's name, email, and total amount spent.
Finds the top 3 users who spent the most.
Calculates the average transaction amount across all users.
Identifies users with no transactions.
Visualizes the results using Dash, including:
A bar chart showing the top 3 spenders.
A line chart or scatter plot of transaction amounts over time.
Tables displaying user reports and users with no transactions.
Customization
You can customize the application by:

Adding more queries and data processing tasks.
Modifying the visualization components and their appearance.
Implementing interactive features like filtering, sorting, and zooming.
Integrating with other data sources or APIs.
Deployment
To deploy the application, you can use a web server like Gunicorn or a cloud platform like Heroku. Refer to the documentation of your chosen deployment method for specific instructions.
